I’m from the Dominican Republic, but I’ve been living in Canada since summer 2018. Since the day, my husband first told me that it would be good for us to move to this country (Canada) until the time that he suggested that I should change career path and go into tech, I been living a roller coaster of emotions in which &lt;strong&gt;FEAR&lt;/strong&gt; has been at the top of all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily identify myself as a person who does not like to dive into the unknown and who is constantly afraid of change for this reason. When my husband suggested me that I should transition into the Tech industry; because according to him I will make a good developer the first thing that I said was “I’m not cut off for that” but to be honest, it wasn’t me who was doing the talking, &lt;strong&gt;it was my fear of not being able to succeed&lt;/strong&gt;. He continued to encourage me to learn to code, but my answer was always the same, so he stopped. It was not until, a year passed of our arrival in Canada, and I was not able to find a job in my field as a teacher, due to that my career is regulated that I decided to give a try to Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ready-to-start-my-journey-into-tech&quot;&gt;Ready to start my journey into Tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of summer 2019, I told my husband that I was ready to give it a try to coding and that I wanted him to teach me (he is a developer). As I said those words my heart almost paralyzed with fear, without realizing it I was getting myself into the unknown, but the feel of being able to do something as challenging as coding was bigger than my despair. I started my journey into coding by reading books, watching videos, and listening to podcasts for newbies. After 3 months into it, I was in love with HTML and CSS. I started building websites for everything, so by then, I knew that I wanted to be a Front-End Web Developer. In November the same year, I went to Juno College to take the Intro to Web Development course, and early this summer 2020; I started my Web Development Bootcamp at &lt;a href=&quot;https://junocollege.com/&quot;&gt;Juno College of Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t let the FEAR get in your way!&lt;/strong&gt; My heart still trembles with fear when I have to start working on a new project, but the excitement of looking back to my beginnings and where I am today in my career as a developer is enough to keep me going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: I make my biggest decisions in the summertime!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My name is Luz De La Rosa.
